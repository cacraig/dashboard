This is a AngularJs prototype for an advertising data dashboard. It just GETs some json, and displays data relevant to each user. This data includes a chart of Conversion rate over a month, a photo of the user (replaced with an SVG of the first letter of the persons name if no photo exists), and some other misc. items.
  
To run/view it:  
  $ cd src  
  $ python -m SimpleHTTPServer  
  
  Then navigate to 0.0.0.0:8000/index.html in your browser.
